# kotlin-style-guide

This repository is intended to discuss the guidance given in the Kotlin style guide. 
Every suggested style rule is a separate issue.
Issues where a sufficient amount of consensus has been reached are closed, and the rules are moved to the official style guide at https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html.
For open issues, comments are welcome.
