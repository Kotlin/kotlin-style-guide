# kotlin-style-guide

This is an obsolete archived repository. For any questions, issues or suggestions about the official style guide, please use public Kotlin Slack or YouTrack bugtracker.

This repository is intended to discuss the guidance given in the Kotlin style guide. 
Every suggested style rule is a separate issue.
Issues where a sufficient amount of consensus has been reached are closed, and the rules are moved to the official style guide at https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html.
For open issues, comments are welcome.
